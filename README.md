# barelly-an-http-server

This is just a very simple HTTP server I've made to help me learn Go.
It's based on the http server challenge in codecrafters.io website, but I've decided to try and extend it a little bit.

## Next Features

This is the next features I'll try to work on:

- Better body parsing;
- Support for multipart;
- Definitions;
  ... More to come :).dd
