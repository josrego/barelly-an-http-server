# barelly-an-http-server

This is just a very simple HTTP server I've made to help me learn Go.
It's based on the http server challenge in codecrafters.io website.

## Next Features

This is the next features I'll try to work on:

- Better URL path parsing (query/path Params);
- Better body parsing for POST/PUT requests;
- Support for multipart;
- Settings;
- CORS;
- Docker container;
